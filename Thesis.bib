Experimental values of polycrystalline isotropic elastic moduli for these materials are presented here, and the validity of the VRH approximation is established. The VRH approximation is then discussed for these materials with respect to their elastic anisotropy of crystals. To provide further support to this work, a numerical confirmation on the VRH moduli is made with the use of a high‐speed computer by calculating the mean velocity of sound in crystals and comparing this result with the corresponding quantity calculated from the actual polycrystalline elastic moduli. The general agreement is observed.},

Predicted Debye temperatures, using a calculated scaling factor, show good agreement with experiments and improvements over the scaling factor derived by Moruzzi et al. Finite-temperature thermodynamic properties of Mg, Zn, Mg4Zn7, MgZn2, and Mg2Zn11 are investigated to show the efficiency and improved accuracy of the calculated scaling factor. For the intermetallic compounds except Mg2Zn11, $\Theta$D predictions are improved upon greatly by implementing a calculated scaling factor. Along the same line, heat capacity is also predicted, showing good agreement with experimental values for these compounds.

Strong and enduring $\beta$-type titanium alloy with a low Young's modulus are being investigated. A low modulus has been proved to be effective in inhibiting bone atrophy, leading to good bone remodeling in a bone fracture model in the rabbit tibia. Very recently $\beta$-type titanium alloys with a self-tunable modulus have been proposed for the construction of removable implants. Nickel-free low modulus $\beta$-type titanium alloys showing shape memory and super elastic behavior are also currently being developed. Nickel-free stainless steel and cobalt–chromium alloys for biomedical applications are receiving attention as well. Newly developed zirconium-based alloys for biomedical applications are proving very interesting. Magnesium-based or iron-based biodegradable biomaterials are under development. Further, tantalum, and niobium and its alloys are being investigated for biomedical applications. The development of new metallic alloys for biomedical applications is described in this paper.},

The supercell method for lattice dynamics is utilized to calculate the phonon density of states, and the thermodynamic properties (heat capacity, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy) of these nitrides at elevated temperatures are predicted via the quasiharmonic approximation. We find that the lattice parameters predicted by GGA agree well with experiments compared to those from LDA. The GGA predicts a larger bond length and a smaller bulk modulus than those from LDA. It is found that the vibrational contribution to Gibbs energy is larger for HfN in comparison with other metal nitrides due to its higher population of phonon density of state in the low frequency region. Calculated structural, phonon, and thermodynamic properties are in good agreement with the available experiments and CALPHAD-type evaluations.},

The structures possess local pair and multisite correlation functions that closely mimic those of the random bcc alloy. We employed the SQSs to predict the mixing enthalpies, nearest neighbor bond length distributions and electronic density of states of bcc Mo–Nb–Ta and Mo–Nb–V solid solutions. Our convergence tests indicate that even small-sized SQSs can give reliable results. Based on the SQS energetics, the predicting powers of the existing empirical ternary extrapolation models were assessed. The present results suggest that it is important to take into account the ternary interaction parameter in order to accurately describe the thermodynamic behaviors of ternary alloys. The proposed SQSs are quite general and can be applied to other ternary bcc alloys.},

The 0-K total energies are calculated using the ab initio plane wave pseudopotential method within the generalized gradient approximation. The contribution to the free energy from the lattice vibration was calculated using the phonon densities of states derived by means of the ab initio linear-response theory. The thermal electronic contribution to the free energy was obtained from the one-dimensional numerical integration over the electronic density of states. With the deduced Helmholtz free-energy, the thermal expansion and enthalpy as a function of temperature were calculated and compared with the experimental data. Our calculations show that the enthalpies of formation are slightly temperature dependent with a slope of −1.6 J/mol/K for NiAl and −1.2 J/mol/K for Ni3Al. For Ni, the inclusion of thermal electronic excitation results in a 10{\%} increase in thermal expansion and 15{\%} increase in enthalpy at 1600 K.},

Ni-free super elastic and shape memory titanium alloys for biomedical applications are energetically developed. Titanium alloys for not only implants, but also dental products like crowns, dentures, etc. are also getting much attention in dentistry. Development of investment materials suitable for titanium alloys with high melting point is desired in dental precision castings. Bioactive surface modifications of titanium alloys for biomedical applications are very important for achieving further developed biocompatibility.

abstract = {A new thermodynamic description of the Re–Ti binary system has been developed by complimenting the CALPHAD modeling technique with first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. Finite temperature thermodynamic properties of the confirmed compound in this system, Re24Ti5, are calculated using the Debye–Gr{\"{u}}neisen model for the sake of simplicity and efficiency. The hcp solid solution phase was predicted from first-principles calculations of special quasirandom structures to have a positive enthalpy of mixing, indicating the existence of a miscibility gap. The bcc solid solution phase was also predicted from the use of special quasirandom structures to have a negative enthalpy of mixing indicating a strong tendency for Re solubility in bcc-Ti. Phonon calculations based on the supercell approach are used to investigate finite temperature properties of the reported ReTi compound. By combining the first-principles results and existing experimental phase equilibria data, the Gibbs energy functions of individual phases in the Re–Ti system have been evaluated with and without the ReTi compound. The calculated phase diagram without the ReTi compound shows good agreement with the available experimental data from the literature. Results from the modeling version with the ReTi compound show poorer agreement with the bcc solidus experimental data. The modeling also indicates that ReTi is stable, but could be metastable when the uncertainty of the first-principles calculations is taken in to account.},

abstract = {The cause of a low Young's modulus was investigated in quaternary $\beta$-type Ti–Nb–Ta–Zr alloys, as the modulus is decreased to prevent bone absorption and degradation of bone quality when these alloys are implanted into human bones. This investigation was carried out using the alloys′ single crystals. Acoustic measurements and analysis by the Hill approximation revealed that a low Young's modulus in a polycrystalline form is caused by the low shear modulus c′, related to the low $\beta$-phase stability, low c44, and relatively low bulk modulus B compared with those of binary Ti-based alloys. Furthermore, it was found that the single crystals had strong orientation dependence on Young's modulus, where that in the 〈1 0 0〉-direction E100 is the lowest of all crystallographic orientations. For quaternary Ti–29Nb–13Ta–4.6Zr alloy (mass{\%}), E100 is only ∼35 GPa, which is similar to Young's modulus of human cortical bones as a result of the low B and c′. These results indicate that decreases in c′, c44 and B are essential for decreasing Young's modulus of novel $\beta$-type Ti alloys which are expected to be developed in the near future.},

abstract = {The procedure of whole-powder-pattern fitting with-out reference to a structural model, first proposed by Pawley for use with neutron powder data [J. Appl. Cryst. (1981), 14, 357-361], was extended as a tool for analyzing X-ray whole-powder data. X-ray data for {\~{}}-SiO 2, {\~{}}-A120 3 and CaCO 3 used as test samples were first analyzed by individual profile-fitting techniques to establish the angle-dependent profile-shape model. Then the results were incorporated into the profile model of whole-powder-pattern fitting, where peak maximum positions of individual reflections are a function of unit-cell parameters while integrated in-tensities are independent variables. Whole-powder-pattern fits for the test samples showed that the correction for peak shift has a large influence on the overall fit of the pattern and the accuracy of refined parameters. It is also important to take into account the asymmetry and the angular dependence of the intensity decay rate in modelling the diffraction pro-file. The method developed was applied to an analysis of the powder pattern of a mixed monoclinic-tetragonal ZrO2.},
